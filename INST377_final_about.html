        <h1>Defining the Information Problem</h1>
        <p>
          With the heavy reliance on teamwork in Valorant, it can be difficult
          to figure out what agents to play as when loading into a match. Each
          map has it's own individual quirks and this can affect agent usability
          across each one. This is especially heightened for beginner players as
          favorable agent choices tend tend to not be that important and most
          rely on their pure aiming skill. As you reach the middle and higher
          ranks however, teamwork becomes a bigger emphasis and players can
          often get stuck in certain ranks because they donâ€™t know how to
          optimize their agent selection for certain maps. The variety of roles
          also lead to even more choice overload.
        </p>
        <h1>Intended Use Case</h1>
        <p>
          This website acts as a beginner guide to competitive Valorant. There
          brief information available such as competitive ranks, the top 3
          weapons in the game, a list of all the agents in the game, as well as
          the maps that are available. Proper agent selection and proper role
          distribution is key to team success as they heavily impact how
          coordinated your team is and this is the use case that this website
          aims to serve most. By simply searching a map through the agent
          matcher page, one can view the most ideal agents to select on a map
          basis based on win percentage.

          University of Maryland majoring in Information Science. I am expecting
